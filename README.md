Paper rock scissors is a game that will outlast all games because it is a game that only needs hands to play and with some luck, win.

I'm making this game to meet the requirements of a company interested in hiring me. They only allow the use of HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and jQuery.

If you're impressed by my game and would like to hire a developer, please visit my site, gastonlenotre.org.
